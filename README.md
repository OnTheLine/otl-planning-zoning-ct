By 1957, 77 percent (131 out of 169) of town governments had established some type of planning and/or zoning agency, according to the Connecticut Development Commission, and most of these were located in the rapidly-suburbanizing regions around Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport.

Barkhamstead is one of the few towns without planning or zoning agency in 1957, and its center is almost 20 miles from Hartford's city center.
